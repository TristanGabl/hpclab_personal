The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) gcc/4.8.5 => gcc/11.4.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[22734,0],0] on node eu-a2p-341
  Remote daemon: [[22734,0],42] on node eu-a2p-389

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
